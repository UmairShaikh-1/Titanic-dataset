# EDA & Feature Engineering on Titanic dataset
This is a beginner friendly project with the aim of applying exploratory data analysis and feature engineering on the Titanic dataset to predict who survived the shipwreck. This project was made soley for the purpose of learning and gaining experience in the field of data science.

Techniques used:
Exploratory Data Analysis: I created visualizations to analyze and compare each feature in the dataset.
Feature Engineering: I extracted features ('Family Size','Title') from existing columns to get more insight on the data.
Data Cleaning: I filled in the missing values and made the data ready for training.
Model Building: I build a logistic regression model for classifying the data.

libraries used:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Findings:
Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than male passengers.
Passengers in first class had a much greater chance of survival compared to those in second and third class.
Surprisingly, passengers with titles like 'Dr.' did not necessarily have a higher survival rate.

Running the porject:
1. Clone this repository:
git clone [Titanic Dataset.py](https://github.com/UmairShaikh-1/Titanic-dataset)

2. Install the required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
python Titanic Dataset.py
